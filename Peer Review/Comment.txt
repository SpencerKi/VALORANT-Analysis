An interesting topic of study! However, the requirement for the final project is that we must design randomised experiments, where we directly influence the observed units with clear treatments (see the "Project Help" announcement on Quercus). Your current plan seems to be purely observational, and you don't seem to be affecting restaurants' incomes in any way yourself (beyond, perhaps, eating in them).

Assuming you are able to select a different restaurant-related metric that you can actively affect, the levels of your factors are still a bit vague. In your report, you may have to clear up how exactly you separate "downtown" vs "GTA" (e.g., perhaps 'end' the downtown at Highway 401 northbound, and choose similar borders for the east and west) and more clearly define "asian" and "north american / european." Even if these are clearly defined, you may still want to focus your factor criteria further, or else your results may not be appropriately blocked (e.g., are ramen and dim sum similar enough to be in the same "asian" category? What about fine Italian dining and McDonald's in "north american / european"?). The same idea applies to what "around" means in the levels of your 'price per person' factor. On a more minor note, I am unsure how you are going to collect information on these restaurants' incomes, and you should specify such in your methodology.

Finally, regarding your statistical analysis plan, you should specify how you will judge which factors have significant effects on each other and to the observed result. Chapter 10.7 of the textbook describes the interpretation of experimental results. Additional visuals to better represent the spread of observations would also help (e.g., box plots).
